					Map Toolbox</a>
					<p>
						A collection of various useful map-making elements that I have accrued over the years through making
						various sceneries. From airport runway bases to approach lighting, to runway touchdown zone lighting,
						some ramp signs and more, it has a lot of useful elements that make airport and map work just a
						little more quicker and easier. I also update it whenever I create new elements, so keep checking
						back for periodic updates to this in the <a href="index.html">GRID</a>!

					MaPS for Maps</a>
					<p>
						A Word document that has become my one-stop-shop for anything measurement or "specifics-related" when
						doing anything with maps in YS Flight. Just a few of the things I have in this document include things
						like showing the equivalent of one mile in feet and meters, standard widths of runways, runway shoulders,
						distance between the PAPI and ILS box for runways, RGB colour codes for runway and taxiway lighting,
						different colours for geographical areas, guidance on how to place J-lines for different aircraft and
						much more. If you need a comprehensive guide when making maps, you might find this quite helpful.

					target="_blank">T.R.A.C.K. | ATC Assistant for YS Flight</a>
					<p>
						My first web-based application for YS Flight! Named the Terminal Region Airspace Control Kit (or T.R.A.C.K.
						for short), it allows an air traffic controller to manage flights for an ATC session for YS Flight. The tool
						allows the person using it to generate flight information tabs, which are sorted into "Departures" or
						"Arrivals" columns. The tabs can then be re-sorted within their respective columns, or dragged-and-dropped
						into either column (i.e. they are cross-listable). Any tab can also be changed to a red colour to denote an
						emergency for that particular flight! I highly recommend reading the "Help" section for the program	as it
						contains a comprehensive guide to using the application.
