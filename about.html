				About the author
			</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! I am Turbofan from <a href="https://forum.ysfhq.com/index.php" target="_blank">YS Flight Headquarters</a>, and I am an avid aviation
				enthusiast. I enjoy travelling, most importantly by air (of course!) and seeing new places. My love of aviation goes back a
				long way, so it's no surprise that I also enjoy flight simulation. I have been a member of the YS Flight online community
				since the YSTK days (the first real English-based fansite and forum). That was back in 2002, and I have been a fan of YSFS
				ever since. I have been creating original, fictional maps since 2011, and they are now extensively used by many members of
				the community, both offline and online. I have also repainted the Beechcraft Super Kingair 200 (though I am not known for
				aircraft repaints - that I will leave to the real repaint and aircraft creating masters). 
			</p>
			<p>
				I love creating maps that are interesting for the YSFS pilot to fly around, but just detailed enough to where they can be used
				on servers also. You'll find my maps most often on the
				<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/civavserver/" target="_blank">YS Civil Aviation Server - Weapons Loaded</a>. Just look in the "Map
				Rotation" section on that website. All of my maps also come with airfield night lighting, as well as city lighting for night-mode
				operations.
