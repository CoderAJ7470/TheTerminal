				Modification Policy For My Maps
			</h1>

			<p class="smallMessage">Policy revised on July 3, 2018</p>

			<p class="modificationPolicyPara">
				As always, anyone is free to edit my maps provided the following guidelines are observed:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You give me credit for the original base map you are modifying</li>
				<li>My map is not physically "relocated" from its geographical region to "fit" into your
					map's region (this applies to instances where someone wants to include my map in a
					fictional or real-life map region of their own and in doing so, basically "move" my map
					into the geographical region of their map; I know this point will probably generate some
					debate but I am open to discussion on the particulars through pm or on Discord through
					private chat).
				</li>
				<li>You clearly state that the modified part of the map is your work</li>
				<li>You adhere to the standards of my maps on basics like taxiway lines, taxiways, runways etc.</li>
				<li class="bold">I am allowed to review your work before releasing the modification of my map/s. Failure
					to do so will result in your modification release being temporarily or permanently suspended
				</li>
			</ul>
