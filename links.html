			<h3>Some of my favourite sites for additional information about the game,
				addons/addon packs and more!</h3>
			<ul class="externalLinks">
				<li><a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/main/e2017.html" target="_blank">
					YS Flight Official Website</a>
					- Where it all began! This is the author's main website
					for the simulator. You can download the latest stable release or, when he
					releases it, the latest beta-test version of the game. The download
					comes ready with over 40 different types of planes, many sceneries/maps
					and driveable ground objects like the stock jeep for instance (2013 version and
					later).	This website also has the Scenery Editor, a program you can use to create
					new maps/sceneries or modify existing ones. The simplicity of YS Flight Simulator
					is a major draw for those who love flight simming, plus, it is one of those games
					where literally, the sky
					<a href="https://ysflight.org/" target="_blank">is the limit</a>. By the way, did I
					mention this is a completely free simulator? Yes, <b><i>completely free</i></b>.
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://ysfhq.com" target="_blank">YS Flight Headquarters (YSFHQ)</a>
					- This is the largest English-based YSFS fansite. If you like YSFS, you owe it to
					yourself to at least check this out. Now with over 1,000 members, YSFHQ has become
					one of the "go-to" sites to access the world of YS Flight. This is a true multi-national
					online community, where you'll find members from several different countries. Here you'll
					have access to various servers for online flying, a large addons/mods base, helpful
					tutorials on everything from installing addons to creating your own sceneries and aircraft,
					combat and civilian squads (virtual airlines and aerobatics), and more! 
				</li>				
				
				<li>
				<a href="https://www41.atwiki.jp/ysflight/pages/1.html"
					target="_blank">YS Flight@2ch</a>
					- Home of the <a href="https://www41.atwiki.jp/ysflight/pages/36.html">187 Server</a>, 2ch is
					a website that has been around for more than a decade. It is one of the most popular Japanese
					YS Flight websites and hosts several different sceneries, aircraft and also contains the
					download of the famous General Air Combat repaint pack (GACrp). If you don't speak Japanese, I
					recommend you use Google Chrome, which has a handy translator in the address bar you can use to
					translate the page.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<a href="http://www.ysflight.ca/index.php"
					target="_blank">Taskforce 58's YS Flight Hangar</a>
					- TF58 is a veteran when it comes to aircraft, vehicles and maps for YS Flight.
					One of the early "pioneers" of high-quality aircraft and modding, his works
					span from a simple (yet detailed enough) fire engine and simple airliners
					to highly-detailed works like the Boeing 747-400, MiG 15s/21s, modifications
					of the C-17 GlobeMaster and the Boeing 757... not to mention high-quality
					works like the sceneries of Cold Lake Air Base, Canada and Edwards Air Force
					Base in California. I have only scratched the surface here, the list goes on
					and on. There's no way I could do justice to his fantastic addons and mods in words,
					so go visit his website and get all of his packs. Highly recommended!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://stargear.web.fc2.com/products/akira/en_repaint.html"
					target="_blank">
					Akira's YS Flight Field</a>
					- Contains a detailed repaint of Taskforce 58's
					<a href="http://www.ysflight.ca/index.php?menu=menu_ac&amp;page=747"
					target="_blank" >Boeing 747-400</a> in All Nippon Airways' colours. Very nicely
					done I might add!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://www.heinkel.jp/yspack/yspack_eng.html" target="_blank">
					CHF Pack</a>
					- If detailed is what you're looking for (read: MSFS quality), then you're at the
					right place. CHF is well-known for accurately created, original works, such as the
					Boeing 777 (all variants), the Kawasaki C-2, P-1 and OH-2, and other downloadables such
					as detailed weapons. A must-visit site for any YSFS user.
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/ckp/" target="_blank">C.K. Packs</a>
					- A large variety of addon packs here, including the famous Control's
					Expansion Packs
					<a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/ckp/CEP/cep.html" target="_blank">
						(CEP 1 and CEP 2)</a>,
					<a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/ckp/Buta/Buta.html"
						target="_blank">Buta Packs</a>,
					<a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/ckp/Kzs%20Pack/Kzspack.html"
						target="_blank">KZS Packs</a> (combat and civilian aircraft, as well
						as sceneries), and more!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ysdecaff/home" target="_blank">
					Decaff's Addons</a>
					- Since joining YSFHQ in 2011, decaff has emerged as one of the "cream-of-the-crop"
					addon and repaint masters for YS Flight. His creations span quite a few models, most
					notably high-detailed models including but not limited to: the B717-200,
					B727-100/-200/-200Adv, B737NG, B757-200, B767-200ER/-300ER/-400ER, B747-8F/-8I, upgraded
					quality B707-300, and most recently The Bombardier C-Series and the Lockheed Martin F-35.
					This website's a must-visit for any YS fan.  
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/matth3w1/" target="_blank">
					Matthew's Addons and Creations (M.A.C.)</a>
					- Contains extremely detailed and picturesque sceneries/maps for YSFS.
					Ranging from the highly popular Scenery Pack A that contains the very
					detailed Chicago map (which includes 12 other Midwest cities) to fictional
					cities with very nicely done airports, to the 241st base at Porlamar,
					this is another one of those must-visit	sites for those who want detailed
					addon maps. You will find detailed highway interchanges, ground objects
					like high-rises and skyscrapers etc. Or if you want something different,
					how about an actual rock band with characters that play musical instruments
					for YSFS?! Check it out!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://free-kr.t-com.hr/owl/" target="_blank">
					Owl's Addons</a>
					- Much like Taskforce 58, Owl is one of the "early pioneers" of addon
					creation (in my books anyway). Contains simple and detailed aircraft,
					including the Airbus 320 family (with moving surfaces), and others like the
					Avro RJ family, simple versions of the Cessna Citation and much more. Also has
					the Zagreb, Croatia scenery, which is very skillfully done.
					Highly recommended!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/oranleed/" target="_blank">
					Oranleed's Collection</a>
					- Another "must-visit" site for YS fans. This website goes back to the early days
					of YS Flight. Contains dozens upon dozens of detailed combat aircraft,
					heavy-lift aircraft, vehicles and more from the
					<a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/oranleed/collection/collection.html"
						target="_blank">1940's to the 2000's</a>. Also contains some maps.
					Visit
					<a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/oranleed/hangar/hangar.html"
						target="_blank">this page</a> to download the awesome packs.
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yspmnv/pmnv-maps" target="_blank">
					PMNV Creations</a>
					- The founder and CEO of 
					<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/natcomair/natcomair-hangar"
						target="_blank">
						NatComAir</a> virtual airlines,
					PatrickN is yet another skilled creator in the YSFS community. His website
					contains high-quality, low-intensity sceneries and maps that range in size
					from the small yet fun Naval Air Station Pensacola to the vast Guam-to-Socal
					scenery, a "gathering" of several of his own sceneries into a fun map for
					any commercial aviation enthusiast (like me). Again, talking about five map
					packs, a vast array of quality ground objects and more will not do it justice,
					so without further ado I suggest you go and pay his website a visit (and
					download the sceneries). And did I mention he also repaints/mods 
					<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yspmnv/pmnv-hangar" 
						target="_blank">aircraft</a>?
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://stargear.web.fc2.com/products/products.html" target="_blank">
					Takaty (Stargear)</a>
					- Contains highly-detailed original aircraft, like the Classic 737 family
					(the -300, -400 and -500 variants), excellent high-quality ground service
					vehicles and a nicely done West-Japan map. Also has links to very detailed
					aircraft created by other modders, including the Dash 8-Q400 and Cessna
					CitationX. A must-visit!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ysflightmotosport" target="_blank">
					Tigershark (YS Flight Motorsport)</a>
					- Proof positive that when one says anything is possible in YS Flight, one
					really means it! Tigershark has made a name for himself with his excellent,
					high-quality addons, such as aircraft repaints, new models and more recently,
					dream cars and sports cars. In fact, check out his
					<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ysflightmotosport/cars" target="_blank">
						cars</a> page, you will be pleasantly surprised. Also contains
						other works like some Airbus repaints, a few maps and an entire pack of
						large cargo trucks that have been repainted with company logos. Go check
						it out!
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>YS Flight - Virtual Airlines (VAs)</h2>
			<p>The following links will take you to the home pages of the active VAs in the
				YS Flight Community. VAs are a great way to get involved and have fun, but
				they're not ones that make unrealistic requirements or make you be a "professional"
				pilot. It's all for good, clean fun! Check them out!</p>
				
			<ul class="externalLinks">
				<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/natcomair/natcomair-hangar"
					target="_blank">
					National and Commuter (NatCom) Virtual Airlines (NCA)</a>
					- NatCom Virtual Airlines has been around the YSFS scene for quite some time now,
					and it has steadily grown to include 9 maps as its service
					regions. NatCom has a diverse fleet ranging from small props/turboprops like the
					Beechcraft Super King Air and Cessna 182 all the way to the Boeing
					747-400. The most recent addition to the fleet includes a Cessna CitationX
					and a Bombardier Dash 8	Q-400. 15 different types of aircraft in the fleet!
					Not to mention NCA has a hummer limo that provides ground transportation for
					elite passengers. A smaller "Bush Frontiers" division that flies mainly for
					remote services and bush pilot flying is also a part of NCA, and has
					mainly small props such as the Cessna 208 Caravan, the DHC-6 Twin Otter and
					Mitsubishi MU-2 Peacock. Natcom has multiple hubs and destinations in the virtual world,
					and with its recent acquisition of the former YGL Group airlines, has gained a new division and
					new hubs in Hawaii and the fictional Atlantica. Highly recommended!
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://penguinairwaysva.weebly.com"
					target="_blank">Penguin Airways VA</a>
					- A quirky name, but nothing quirky about the operations of this VA. Penguin Virtual has
					been on the YS scene since 2011 and has a diverse fleet of aircraft, including Boeing
					products such as the 757-200 and 737-800, while the long-haul fleet mixes things up with
					767s and 330 Freighters. Also included are the E195, 319 and MD-80. It also flies to multiple
					destinations around the virtual world. Definitely one of the more popular virtual airlines for
					YSFS with a unique livery.
				</li>
				
				<li><a href="http://abeljetsgroup.weebly.com"
					target="_blank">Abel Jets Group</a>
					- A relative newcomer to the YS scene, Abel Jets has quickly made a name for itself, with its
					HQ in the city of Mandiola and main hub at the Mandiola International Airport, on Turbot Island.
					This VA's main region of operation is in the fictional Central Mediterranean Islands (which you
					can download on this site), and its second hub is located at Linbury City International Airport,
					in Linbury, on Winnsworth Island. Abel Jets is part of the large Abel Jets Group of VAs, which also
					includes Global Logistics, T-tail Airways and Abel Jets Hawaii. Not surprisingly, Abel Jets and the 
					Abel Jets Group combined have a large and diverse fleet of aircraft, including but not limited to the
					Boeing 747-400, 767-200ER/300ER, both Classic and Next-Generation 737s, Airbus 319s/320NEOs, as well 
					as several commuter models such as the Avroliner RJ-85, Dash 8-Q400 and Embraer Brasilia 120. Did I 
					mention the	<a href="http://abeljetsgroup.weebly.com/screenshot-gallery.html">various</a> special livery
					aircraft and some unique fleet members like the Kawasaki C-2? Plus with its Hawaii division, a hub at
					Honolulu International Airport is also part of the Abel Jets Group network. Not to mention dozens of
					destinations around the virtual world. A visit to its website is definitely recommended if you're into VAs!
