			<h2>
				Welcome!
			</h2>
			<p>
				Hi! This is Turbofan from
				<a href="http://ysfhq.com" target="_blank">YS Flight Headquarters</a>
				(YSFHQ). This is the website where you can access my YS Flight Simulator (YSFS)
				addons, check out my YSFS screenshots, view some sample spotting videos
				recorded from my YSFS replays and more!
			</p>
			<h2>
				So, what is "YS Flight Simulator?"
			</h2>
			<p>
				YS Flight Simulator is a completely free, awesome flight simulation game (and then some).
				That is right, completely free. Since the first release in 1999, it has 
				undergone multiple improvements over the past decade (and more!). With a large
				online community at YS Flight Headquarters 
				<a href="http://ysfhq.com" target="_blank">(YSFHQ)</a>,
				as well as a large Japanese
				community and some branch forums, there are literally hundreds of addons in the
				form of packs and individual releases.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can fly offline, or online on servers. You can fly civilian and
				commercial planes from small props to airliners, or do combat in highly
				detailed fighters and bombers, or if you fancy, get in an aerobatic plane like this
				<a href="http://forum.ysfhq.com/viewtopic.php?f=169&amp;t=6481"
				target="_blank">
					Extra 300</a> and do some fancy maneuvers!	
				Addons range from small and large jets to wonderful sceneries and maps,
				to highly detailed air force aircraft, aircraft carriers, weapons etc.
				Or maybe aircraft are not what you are after and you're more into cars,
				spaceships or maybe even 
				<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzPaNTD8cWA" target="_blank">
					Asimo</a>?
			</p>
			<p>
				Now at first glance, the graphics of the sceneries might seem old-school and not
				that impressive, which is understandable especially for someone used to the latest
				graphics renderings, but keep in mind, this simulator has been tuned to be
				compatible for older computers as well. That being said, the coming 2014 release
				does show the inclusion of image-based ground texturing. To be completely honest
				though, I find the flexibility and simplicity of the game, coupled with the vast
				array of addons and packs (and did I mention it's free?) basically eliminate the
				"graphics" deal (for lack of a better expression). I could go on and on, but I
				recommend you start at the game author's
				<a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/software/e.html" target="_blank">
					website</a>, where you'll find not only the game itself but other creations,
				including a new 3D modelling program in which you can create aircraft.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				I do not see any combat aircraft?
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				There do not seem to be any combat aircraft if you happened to
				come to this website first, but trust me, this simulator has plenty to choose from
				when it comes to combat/military/naval aircraft. If you go to the
				<a href="http://ysfhq.com/community/combat-hq/" target="_blank">combat</a>
				section of YSFHQ, you'll see a whole bunch of stuff on how to learn combat, the
				squadrons, as well as what you can do online with air-to-air combat. I'm a big-time
				fan of all things commercial/civilian (as the subsequent pages will no doubt
				show), that's why this website is geared toward my addons and screenshots that
				display this aspect of the game. If you're into combat and want to see more, I
				refer you to
				<a href="http://ysflight.info/index.php/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8"
					target="_blank">YS Flight@2ch</a> and
				<a href="http://mrsandj.sakura.ne.jp/ht/ckp/"
					target="_blank">CK Packs</a>. More links are listed on the
				<a href="links.html">links</a> page.
